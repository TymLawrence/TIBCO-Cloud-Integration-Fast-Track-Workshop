# Creating a Mock  Application from the API Specification
Once an API spec is created, we can create an application to implement the spec. To follow best practices, create a mock application. This way, you can call the mock application, and ensure that it works as expected.

*In other words, fake the app before you start to make the app.*

A mock application allows developers and business analysts to agree on the functionality of the intended API.
Architects and developers can get a head start on their work by leveraging the Mock API well before the implemented API goes into production and receive/provide feedback and changes earlier in the API development lifecycle. TCI supports continuous planning, development, and testing.

## Create the Mock App
In order to create our Mock Application, click on the 3 dots to the right of the API Specification and select Create Mock Application as shown below:

Accept the defaults as shown below and click create:

## Test the Mock App
In order to test the Mock Application, click on the 3 dots to the right of the API Specification and select "Go to Mock app".
(The 'Create Mock app' will toggle to 'Go to Mock app' once the mock app is running).
Once the application has been created and scaled, click on the endpoint and test it as shown below:

Scroll down to the sample payload and click try it out:

Notice the successful return code and sample data. Your Mock app is ready for testing by your developers:

## Summary
Creating Mock Apps is as simple as a mouse click within TIBCO Cloud Integration.  In this section, we leveraged the API that was created, generated and deployed a mock application to the cloud and tested the API end point.

In the next section, we will implement the full back end microservice using a web based editor inside TCI to create an Application based on this agreed upon and mock tested API.
